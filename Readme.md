**CalEPD is an ESP-IDF C++ component to drive epaper displays with ESP32 / ESP32S2**

This repository is a Platformio skeleton which unique aim is to make configuration using build variables easier.

However there are still a few gotchas to resolve that we will clarify in the WiKi section in order to have a successful build. This will probably go away after some days of testing and collaborations from our component developers
