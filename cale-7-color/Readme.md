## Cale 7 color WiFi download BMP example

This will download a WiFi URL that should deliver a BMP image (Either 4 bit or 24 bit-depth)#

For that we recomment using [CALE image service at cale.es](https://cale.es) where you can add an Image gallery to your desired screen and will create an URL for you. 

Please do not forget to run:

    pio run -t menuconfig#

in order to configure your WiFi connection plus the desired URL.
